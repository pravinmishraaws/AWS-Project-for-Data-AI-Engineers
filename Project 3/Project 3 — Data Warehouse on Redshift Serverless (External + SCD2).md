## Youâ€™ll stand up a Redshift Serverless warehouse that: 

#### 1. Redshift Serverless Workgroup and Namespace 
- A running Serverless endpoint you can connect to (psql, Query Editor v2). 

#### 2. External schema (Redshift Spectrum) pointing to Glue / Iceberg 
- You can SELECT the Iceberg tables in place from Redshift (no copy). 

#### 3. Implements SCD Type 2 with a MERGE to track attribute history. 
- A dimension table that keeps full attribute history over time. 

#### 4. Exposes a materialized view for BI. 
- Low-latency, predictable query surfaces for dashboards. 

#### 5. Shows concurrency/cost controls via WLM & Query Monitoring Rules (QMR). 
- Predictable performance and spend; noisy neighbors get constrained.
